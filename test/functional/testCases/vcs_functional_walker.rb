  # This test class have tests that verifies that we collect the correct commits
  # for a given repository called pac-test-repo.zip.
  # The test repository is contructed in a way that holds branches that are not merged
  # in yet, as well as merged branches. Merges are done like the Pretested Integration Plugin
  # for the Automated Git flow would do it (git merge -no-ff).
  # These verifications are do ensure the tree-walker traversing the git commits
  # follows the correct path in the topological search.
  #
  # These test cases are created based on a specific user case, where an issue was found
  # if the history had certain topoplog. Problem was the walker collecting the git commits
  # wasn't following topological order, but data order. Thus the pac-test-repo repository
  # created shows exactly this problem.
  #
  # Every test have three phases, each one verifies two lists - whitelist and blacklist
  # 1. Verify whitelist, that is all commits on the branch (master) between topological 
  # order of from and to SHA givens is collected. Blacklist is those commits not expected to be found, those only belonging to a branch that is not master
  # 2. Verifies whitelist of issue numbers (id, or references they are also called) which is a list of references found in the commit message. 
  # The blacklist are those issue numbers we do not expect because they are in commits that should be found.
  # 3. The un-referenced verification is checking that all commits that doesn't have a reference is in our list of such commits, while there should be no
  # commits there if they have a reference. The un-references list of commits is typically presented in the report.

# Contributing


* Simple factual changes, typos, wording etc. can be done using pull requests without any further planning.
* You're also welcome to use Github Pull Request as a collaboration request, for just sharing thoughts etc. Please file proper description then when opening the PR.

## Conceptual and larger changes

We follow our pragmatic workflow using Github issues, labels and milestones. Read these two blog posts:

* http://www.praqma.com/stories/a-pragmatic-workflow/
* http://www.praqma.com/stories/milestones-and-officehours

In real life ...

* create an issue explaining your idea
* if you want to work on an issue, it needs to be prioritized by a PO

_If you want to change something - you will always need to interact with a product owner for conceptual and larger changes._


## Releases

A release is a tagged version of the repository following semantic versioning.

See [/docs/versioning.md](/docs/versioning.md)

## Responsibilites

Product owners:

* Mads Nielsen (Github handle: @MadsNielsen)
* Peers: Jan Krag (Github handle: @JKrag), Claus Schneider (Github handle: @bicschneider)

_Product owners_ will take the daily responsibility for any change:

* that changes conform and agree with our roadmap and our testing strategy
* accept pull requests
* manage and plan issues
* make sure site- and office specific details are cleared with the relevant persons

The product owner will make sure changes comply with roadmap and the concept owners agree.

The _concept owners_ have the overall vision and make decisions on roadmap level, but on daily basis the product owners carry out the decision.

* Mads Nielsen
